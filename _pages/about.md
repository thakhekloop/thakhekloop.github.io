Hey! My name is Andrew, nice to meet you 😊. I am originally from the sunny state of Florida, but lived and studied for in North Carolina before moving to Swtizerland, where I have lived for the past 8-odd years. Originally the plan was to come just for my Master's Thesis, but after falling in love with the Alps, then my beautiful now-wife Una, I don't think I'm going back anytime soon 😅.

As is probably evidenced by this website, my interests lie in both technology and travel. I currently work for a tech company in Zurich, Switzerland, escaping on the weekends to enjoy Switzerland's amazing mountains. I enjoy hiking, climbing, and skiing, alibit badly 😅. Of course, I also love getting out of Switzerland and seeing new places, especially since Switzerland's landlocked-ness makes it a bit hard to partake in my favorite sport, diving 😝.
